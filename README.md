# vowel-beat-detector
This program is based on the beat measurement procedure as described on Cummins &amp; Port (1998). A beat is located at (roughly) the midpoint of every local rise in the derivative of the amplitude envelope of a waveform. As a basic functionality, the program receives audio files as input and outputs arrays with timestamps of the detected beats.
